# rPi-RSS
Hello! This repository holds the code for the [RSS aggregator](https://johngnicholas.github.io/rss_feed/feed.html) on my [website](https://johngnicholas.github.io), as well as instructions on how to add one to your website!

This project requires [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). These packages are open-source and freely available in package managers such as [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and [Conda](https://conda.io).
